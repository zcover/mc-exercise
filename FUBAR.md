This one time at band camp.  Bob and Carol did a thing... involving a clairinet, 50 feet of rope and 3 packs of ice.  Not the good ice, like the bad ice.  It was literally a brick of ice.


# Analysis of Joke
Band camp is representative of the psyche
The clarinet is representative of Bob's father
The ice is representative of Carol's mother.
