## Problems from today's lab
* Checking out a new branch before updating the master branch. 

* Before starting to work on something, if person doesn't update their file from the master, merge conflicts can occur. 

* Multiple people putting in pull requests all at once when those files are not updated.




## Solution
If we have 5 people working on different files, on different branches:
Person 1 pushes to master.
Everyone pulls from master.
Person 2 pushes to master. If it works, everyone pulls from master
And this continues all the way down. 


Each person or pair-programmers is assigned one task, and one does not dip into other people's tasks.
